# this program computes the number of seconds in each number of hours
# this program has been written two days ago
a = 2 # number of hours
seconds = 3600 # number of seconds in 1 hour
print("Hours:",a)#printing the number of hours
# print("Seconds in hours:",a * seconds) # printing number of seconds


# here we should also print "Goodbye", but a programmer didn't have time to write any code
# I Will do it Then - Corbin
print("Goodbye")
# this is the end of the program that computes the number of seconds in 3 hour
